and open an issue with a proposal when suggesting a new feature of behavioural
change. We don't want you to waste your efforts on a pull request that we won't
want to accept.

## Pull requests

**Before submitting a pull request**, please make sure the following is done:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!

4. Ensure the tests pass (`npm run test`).

You can now submit a pull request, referencing any issues it addresses.

Please try to keep your pull request focused in scope and avoid including
unrelated commits.

as possible. We may suggest some changes or improvements.
