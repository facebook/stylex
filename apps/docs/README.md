# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern static website generator.

### build stylex packages

- stylex actual package, and then the @stylexjs/babel-plugin plugin in node_modules

```bash
$ npm run build -w @stylexjs/stylex -w @stylexjs/shared -w @stylexjs/eslint-plugin -w @stylexjs/babel-plugin
```

### Installation

```bash
$ npm install 
```

### Local Development

```bash
$ npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```bash
$ USE_SSH=true npm run deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```bash
$ GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> npm run deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.

### Continuous Integration

Some common defaults for linting/formatting have been set for you. If you integrate your project with an open source Continuous Integration system (e.g. Travis CI, CircleCI), you may check for issues using the following command.

```bash
$ npm run ci
```
