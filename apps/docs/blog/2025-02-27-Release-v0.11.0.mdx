# Release 0.11.0

## Release Notes

StyleX v0.11.0 is now available, with significant improvements in debugging, CLI caching, and documentation!

import Dial from '../components/Dial';

<Dial />

## Debugging Improvements

### Improved Runtime Debugging
We've made some big improvements to the information available in debug mode. We now include sourceMap information to indicate the file and line of the `stylex.create` call responsible for providing styles on a given element. This information is contained in the `data-style-src` prop in the DOM. To use, set `debug` to `true` in the StyleX config. (Thanks [necolas](https://github.com/necolas))

## CLI Cache Improvements

The StyleX CLI now includes better cache invalidation and expanded support:
- Cache now invalidates when config options change in the `StyleX` and `.babelrc` configurations
- Added support for relative file paths
- Now supports Deno applications

## Documentation Updates

### New theming recipes
We've added new documentation that provides improved guidance on [theming](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/recipes), including best practices for resetting and merging themes, as well as dynamic color-scheme management using built-in functions. (Thanks [nmn](https://github.com/nmn))

### API enhancements
We've added documentation about the new [PostCSS plugin](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/configuration/postcss-plugin/) and updated the docs to reflect the latest debug information. (Thanks [necolas](https://github.com/necolas))

## Miscellaneous

- We've added exported return types for `stylex.types.*` functions such as `stylex.Color` and `stylex.Length`. Now, expressions like `stylex.types.color("red")` are explicitly typed as `stylex.Color<string>` (Thanks [nmn](https://github.com/nmn))
- We've added an autofix to the `valid-styles` rule to provide autofix suggestions for border styles
- We've made a fix to how we process multivalue shorthands with slashes (Thanks [yasuhiro-yamamoto](https://github.com/yasuhiro-yamamoto))
- Small typo fixes (Thanks [mattstyles](https://github.com/mattstyles) and [necolas](https://github.com/necolas))
