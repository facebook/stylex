StyleX v0.8.0 is now available with a bunch of fixes and new ESlint rules.

## Linting Enhancements

We've been making a lot of improvements to our ESLint plugin. We've both improved
our existing rules and added new ones. Thanks to [Melissa Liu](https://github.com/mellyeliu)!

Here are some of the highlights:

### New `valid-shorthands` rule

This rule enforces our opinions on when and how you should use CSS shorthand properties.
It disallows the use of multi-value shorthands for shorthands, and disallows certain
properties altogether.

```tsx
const styles = stylex({
  invalidShorthands: {
    // border shorthands are entirely disallowed
    // Use `borderWidth`, `borderStyle`, and `borderColor` instead
    border: '1px solid black',
    // Multiple values for different sides within the same shorthand are disallowed
    borderWidth: '1px 2px 3px 4px',
    margin: '10px 20px 30px',
    padding: '10px 20px',
  },
  validShorthands: {
    borderBottomWidth: 3,
    borderColor: 'black',
    borderInlineEndWidth: 2,
    borderInlineStartWidth: 4,
    borderStyle: 'solid',
    borderTopWidth: 1,
    marginBottom: 30,
    marginInline: 20,
    marginTop: 10,
    paddingBlock: 10,
    paddingInline: 20,
  },
});
```

These opinions guide you towards the most consistent and most re-usable CSS.

### New `enforce-extension` rule

This new rule enforces the [rules when defining variables](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/theming/defining-variables/#rules-when-defining-variables)._createMdxContent
It enforces that usages of `stylex.defineVars` are named exports within a file with a `.stylex.js` (or '.ts' or '.jsx' or '.tsx') extension,
and that such a file does not have any other exports.


### Other Lint fixes

We've updated the ESLint rule to include additional missing properties and values.
Notably, the `valid-styles` rule should now understand:

- `fieldSizing` as a valid prop
- `@starting-style` as a valid at-rule.


## Using `lightningcss` for post-processing

StyleX's compilation process is conceptually a three step process:

1. Transform JavaScript source files to replace usages of `stylex.create` etc. 
   with the resulting classNames and collect the generated CSS.
2. De-duplicate and sort all the collected CSS.
3. Write the CSS to a file.

However, often it's useful to post-process the CSS before writing it to a file.
This post-processing can include minification, prefixing, or other transformations.
After much discussion we have decided to standardize on `lightningcss` for this post-processing.

As a first step, we're add `lightningcss` by default for our Rollup Plugin. We will
be rolling out support for our other bundler plugins next.

Thanks [Prakshal Jain](https://github.com/Prakshal-Jain) for his work on this!

## Theming Improvements

We've made two small but important improvements for theming in StyleX.

### Use `stylex.firstThatWorks` to define fallback values for CSS variables.

StyleX has a `stylex.firstThatWorks` function that can be used to define fallback values for CSS property.
This is akin to using the same property multiple times with different values in CSS.

```css
/* Represent this */
.my-class {
  background-color: #808080;
  background-color: oklab(0.5 0.5 0.5);
}
```
```tsx
const styles = stylex.create({
  myClass: {
    // as:
    backgroundColor: stylex.firstThatWorks(
      'oklab(0.5 0.5 0.5)',
      '#808080',
    ),
  },
});
```

Now, the same API will also work for CSS variables.

```css
/* Represent this */
.my-class {
  background-color: var(--bg-color, #808080);
}
```
```tsx
const styles = stylex.create({
  myClass: {
    // as:
    backgroundColor: stylex.firstThatWorks(
      'var(--bg-color)',
      '#808080',
    ),
  },
});
```

### Themes have higher specificity than default var values

The CSS rule created with `stylex.createTheme` now has higher specificity than the rule
created with `stylex.defineVars`.

This should not have been issue in the vast majority of cases already, as we always sorted
the rules in the correct order. However, in extreme edge-cases where you may be loading multiple
StyleX CSS files on the same page, this fix will ensure consistency.


## Other fixes


We've made some other fixes in various parts of StyleX:

- **fix**: Logical values for `textAlign` are no longer converted to `left` and `right`.
- **fix**: [CLI] Handle errors while deleting files gracefully (#695)
- **feat**: Expand configuration options to CLI (#638)
- **fix**: Don't add 'px' units for number values used for variables (#694)
  - **fix**:  Don't add 'px' units for additional properties that accept raw numbers as values (#705)


## Documentation Improvements

We've added documentation for options of our various bundler plugin and added additional
projects to our [ecosystem page](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/ecosystem/).

We've also updated the search on our website to be much more comprehensive and accurate.
