StyleX v0.9.3 is now available with some big improvements and bug-fixes.

## Improvements to Theming APIs

There are some big improvements to the predictability and reliability of our
theming APIs â€” `stylex.defineVars` and `stylex.createTheme`.

### Breaking Change: Themes are now exclusive

When you create a `VarGroup` with `stylex.defineVars`, you are able to theme
any subset of the variables within using the `stylex.createTheme` API. These
themes can then be applied like any other StyleX styles using `stylex.props`
(or `stylex.attrs`). If you try to apply multiple themes for the same `VarGroup`,
on the same element, *the last applied theme wins*, just as you might expect.

However, previously, if you instead applied one theme on a parent element,
and another theme on a child element, the themes would end up being merged.

```tsx
// tokens.stylex.ts
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const varGroup = stylex.defineVars({
  primary: 'black',
  secondary: 'grey',
});
```

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {varGroup} from './tokens.stylex.ts';

const red = stylex.createTheme(varGroup, {
  primary: 'red',
});

const blue = stylex.createTheme(varGroup, {
  secondary: 'blue',
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  primary: {color: varGroup.primary},
  secondary: {color: varGroup.secondary},
});

function App() {
  return (
    <div {...stylex.props(red)}>
      <div {...stylex.props(blue)}>
        <span {...stylex.props(styles.primary)}>Hello </span>
        <span {...stylex.props(styles.secondary)}>World!</span>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Previously this would have resulted in the text "Hello World!" being styled
with a red primary color and a blue secondary color. Now, the text will be
styled with a black primary color and a blue secondary color.

You can think of themes conceptually as *re-applying* the default values for any
variables that are not explicitly overridden by the theme. This change simplifies
the mental model for how themes work, and has the added benefit of making it
easy to create "reset" themes:

```tsx
const reset = stylex.createTheme(varGroup, {});
```

:::tip
You can define this "reset" theme multiple times within your app and they
will all be de-duplicated by the compiler. We encourage you to "repeat yourself"!
:::


### `rootDir` is now optional!

Previously, when configuring the StyleX Babel plugin, you had to explicitly
specify a `rootDir` value. Internally, this path was used to generate a canonical
file path for every `.stylex.js` file in your project.

However, this was not only cumbersome, but it also resulted in errors when importing
`VarGroup`s from `node_modules`. Different package managers deal with packages differently,
and this can be particularly consequential for mono-repos.

Now, the `rootDir` option is optional, and StyleX will use the nearest `package.json` file
to determine the canonical path, automatically. This should make theming APIs work more
reliably.

:::note
When determining the canonical path, StyleX will use the `name` field from the nearest
`package.json` file and the relative path to the `.stylex.js` file. We intentionally
ignore the `version` number.

This means that your project happens to contain multiple versions of the same package,
StyleX will only generate a single set of variables for them. This will usually be
the desired behavior, but you may see some unexpected results if the variables within
the two versions are different.

We will be making further improvements to minimize any such edge-cases.
:::

### More reliable ESM resolution

The StyleX Babel plugin now uses the `esm-resolve` package to resolve ESM imports.
This should fix most situations where the compiler would fail to resolve `VarGroup`
imports in result in the compilation of `stylex.create` to fail.

## Dynamic style improvements

Dynamic Styles within StyleX have been improved to be more reliable and efficient.
Previously, if the dynamic value of a style resolved to `null` at runtime, StyleX
would represent that with the `revert` keyword in CSS. This did not always work as
expected, ran into certain browser bugs and resulted in styles that were unnecessarily
bloated.

In v0.9.3, `null` values for Dynamic styles work exactly the same as using `null`
as a static value within `stylex.create`. This means any previously applied value
for the given property will be removed and no className will be applied for that
property.


## `@stylexjs/dev-runtime` overhaul

The `@stylexjs/dev-runtime` package is a development-only package that lets you use
a *much slower* version of StyleX that runs entirely at runtime. Previously, it worked
by patching the main `@stylexjs/stylex` package at runtime. However, this did not always
work reliably. 

**Breaking Change**: The `@stylexjs/dev-runtime` package now *returns* the StyleX API.

```tsx
import makeStyleX from '@stylexjs/dev-runtime';

const stylex = makeStyleX({
  // configuration options
  classNamePrefix: 'x',
  dev: true,
  test: false,
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  color: 'red',
});
```

:::warning
The `@stylexjs/dev-runtime` only exists as a convenience for development purposes.
It does not completely match the behavior of the StyleX compiler and will always
lack certain features.

**DO NOT** use it in production.

## Improved handling of nested pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes

Fixed a bug where using Pseudo Classes (such as `:hover`) within Pseudo Elements (such as `::before`)
(or vice-versa) would sometimes result in surprising behavior. StyleX now handles such cases, with
an arbitrary level of nesting, correctly.

## Miscellaneous

- Added support for additional Pseudo Elements and Pseudo Classes to our ESLint rule and type definitions.
  - Thanks [aspizu](https://github.com/aspizu) and [nikeee](https://github.com/nikeee)!
- Slightly better compiler error messages.
