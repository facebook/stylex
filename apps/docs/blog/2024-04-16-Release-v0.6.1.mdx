We're excited to release StyleX v0.6.1 with some big improvements for working
with CSS custom properties (aka "variables") as well as numerous bug-fixes.

## Improvements for variables

We've added some new features and improvements for working with variables
and themes in StyleX.

### Fallback values for variables

You can now provide a fallback value for variables defined with the `stylex.defineVars` API.
This new capability does not introduce any new API. Instead, the existing `stylex.firstThatWorks` API
now supports variables as arguments.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {colors} from './tokens.stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  container: {
    color: stylex.firstThatWorks(colors.primary, 'black'),
  },
});
```

Using a list of fallbacks variables is supported.

### Typed variables

StyleX introduces a brand new set of APIs for defining `<syntax>` types for CSS
variables. This results in `@property` rules in the generated CSS output which
can be used to animate CSS variables as well as other special use-cases.

The new `stylex.types.*` functions can be used when defining variables to define
them with a particular type.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const typedTokens = stylex.defineVars({
  bgColor: stylex.types.color<string>({
    default: 'cyan',
    [DARK]: 'navy',
  }),
  cornerRadius: stylex.types.length<string | number>({
    default: '4px',
    '@media (max-width: 600px)': 0,
  }),
  translucent: stylex.types.number<number>(0.5),
  angle: stylex.types.angle<string>('0deg'),
  shortAnimation: stylex.types.time<string>('0.5s'),
});
```

Once variables have been defined with types, they can be animated
with `stylex.keyframes` just like any other CSS property.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {typedTokens} from './tokens.stylex';

const rotate = stylex.keyframes({
  from: { [typedTokens.angle]: '0deg' },
  to: { [typedTokens.angle]: '360deg' },
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  gradient: {
    backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(from ${tokens.angle}, ...colors)`,
    animationName: rotate,
    animationDuration: '10s',
    animationTimingFunction: 'linear',
    animationIterationCount: 'infinite',
  },
})
```

This can be used achieve some interesting effects, such as animating the
`angle` of a conic-gradient:

import AnimatedGradientBox from '../components/AnimatedGradientBox/AnimatedGradientBox';

<AnimatedGradientBox />

This new capability is primarily about CSS types, but the new API
also makes the TypeScript (or Flow) types for the variables more powerful.

As can be seen in the example, generic type arguments can be used to constrain
the values the variable can take when creating themes with `stylex.createTheme`.


## ESlint plugin

### New `sort-keys` rule

We've added a new `sort-keys` rule to the StyleX ESlint plugin. This rule
is a stylistic rule to enforce a consistent order for keys for your StyleX
styles.

Thanks [nedjulius](https://github.com/nedjulius) & [QingqiShi](https://github.com/QingqiShi)

### Improvements to `propLimits` for `valid-styles` rule.

The `valid-styles` rule has been improved to allow more expressive
"prop limits".

## Miscellaneous

- ESlint `'valid-styles'` rule now allows using variables created with
  `stylex.defineVars` as keys within dynamic styles.
- Bug-fixes to the experimental `stylex.include` API
- Fixed debug className generation for `stylex.createTheme`
- Units are no longer removed from `0` values
- Compilation bug-fixes

Our [Ecosystem](/docs/learn/ecosystem/) page continues to grow with community projects. Including a
[Prettier plugin](https://github.com/nedjulius/prettier-plugin-stylex-key-sort) for sorting StyleX styles.
