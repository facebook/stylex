# `StyleXStyles<>`

A type that allows any styles generated by StyleX.

It also allows the styles to be nested within arrays and be arbitrarily deep.
Further, `null`, `undefined` and `false` are always accepted.

Further, you can pass in an object type to constrain the styles
to specific properties and values:

```tsx
import type {StyleXStyles} from '@stylexjs/stylex';

type Props = {
  // ...
  style?: StyleXStyles<{
    color?: 'red' | 'blue' | 'green';
    padding?: 0 | 4 | 8 | 16 | 32;
    backgroundColor?: string;
    borderColor?: string;
    borderTopColor?: string;
    borderEndColor?: string;
    borderBottomColor?: string;
    borderStartColor?: string;
  }>;
};
```

Any key not defined in the object type will be disallowed.

:::danger Only known keys are checked

Due to a TypeScript limitation, any key not in your custom object type
will only be disallowed if it's one of the known style properties
in the internal StyleX types.

TypeScript will not error if you pass an additional unknown key.
