# `Theme<>`

```tsx
type Theme<T extends VarGroup<unknown, symbol>, Tag extends symbol = symbol>
```

A `Theme` is a type that represents a style that *themes* a set of variables in a given
`VarGroup`. It's the result of calling [`stylex.createTheme`](../javascript/createTheme.mdx).


```tsx
import type {VarGroup} from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

import {vars} from './vars.stylex';

export const theme: Theme<typeof vars> = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  color: 'red', // OK
  backgroundColor: 'blue', // OK
});
```

The most common use-case for `Theme` is to accept a theme for a particular set of variables.

By default, all themes for the same `VarGroup` are compatible with each other and have the same
type. However, the second type argument to `Theme<>` can be used to give a theme a unique type.
  
```tsx
import type {VarGroup} from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

import {vars} from './vars.stylex';

declare const DarkThemeTag: unique symbol;
export const theme: Theme<typeof vars, DarkThemeTag> = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  color: 'red', // OK
  backgroundColor: 'blue', // OK
});
```
