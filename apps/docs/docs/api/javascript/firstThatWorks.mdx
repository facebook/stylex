# `stylex.firstThatWorks`

Declare an ordered list of fallback values for a style property.

All of the fallbacks are included in the generated styles so that the first
supported style within the list takes effect within the browser.

```ts
function firstThatWorks<Values extends Array<string | number>>(
  ...styles: Values
): Values[number];
```

### Example use:

```js
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  header: {
    position: stylex.firstThatWorks('sticky', '-webkit-sticky', 'fixed'),
  },
});
```
