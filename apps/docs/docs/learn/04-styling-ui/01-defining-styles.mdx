# Defining styles

StyleX uses an expressive JavaScript API that is similar to working with inline
styles in React DOM, or styles in React Native.

## Constraints

Since StyleX depends on ahead-of-time compilation, it is important for all
your styles to be statically analyzable. This means that every "Raw Style
Object" must only contain:

- Plain Object Literals
- String Literals
- Number Literals
- Array Literals
- `null` or `undefined`
- Constants, simple expressions, and built-in methods (e.g., `.toString()`) that
  resolve to one of the above.
- And arrow functions for dynamic styles

The following are **not** allowed:

- Function calls (except StyleX functions)
- Values imported from other modules (except for CSS Variables created using
  StyleX from a `.stylex.js` file.)

## Creating styles

Styles must be created with the `stylex.create` function. You can define one or
more "namespaces", or objects of styles. In the example below, there are 2
"namespaces" - one called `base` and the other `highlighted`. The names are
arbitrary and represent the constant used to capture the result of the
`create()` function call.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: 'rgb(60,60,60)',
  },
  highlighted: {
    color: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});
```

## Pseudo-classes

Pseudo-classes represent different states of an element. In StyleX, declarations
for pseudo-classes are nested within properties. For example, let's say we have
a button that currently has a `lightblue` background.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'lightblue',
  },
});
```

If we want to add pseudo-classes to change the background color for different
states, we replace the `lightblue` string literal with an object of
pseudo-states.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  button: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'lightblue',
      ':hover': 'blue',
      ':active': 'darkblue',
    },
  },
});
```

## Pseudo-elements

:::note Avoid pseudo elements

We recommend avoiding pseudo-elements when possible and relying on actual HTML
elements instead, i.e., replace `::before` and `::after` with elements like
`div` or `span`.

:::

Pseudo-elements are a way of targeting shadow DOM elements contained within the
native HTML elements provided by user agents. For example, `::placeholder`
references the element that contains placeholder text within an `input` or
`textarea` element. To target pseudo-elements in StyleX, they must be defined as
a top-level key within a namespace.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  input: {
    // pseudo-element
    '::placeholder': {
      color: '#999',
    },
    color: {
      default: '#333',
      // pseudo-class
      ':invalid': 'red',
    },
  },
});
```

## Media queries (and other `@` rules)

Media Queries can, similarly, be as "conditions" within style values.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    width: {
      default: 800,
      '@media (max-width: 800px)': '100%',
    },
  },
});
```

## Combining conditions

Your Style Values can be nested more than one level deep when you need to
combine Media Queries and Pseudo Selectors

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  button: {
    color: {
      default: 'var(--blue-link)',
      ':hover': {
        default: null,
        '@media (hover: hover)': 'scale(1.1)',
      },
      ':active': 'scale(0.9)',
    },
  },
});
```

:::info

The `default` case is required when authoring conditional styles. If you don't
want any style to be applied in the default case, you can use `null` as the
value.

Using `null` for a non-`default` condition has no effect and should be
considered invalid.

:::

## Fallback styles

There are situations in StyleX where, when you need fallback styles for browsers
that don't support a certain new style property.

In CSS you may do something like this:

```css
.header {
  position: fixed;
  position: -webkit-sticky;
  position: sticky;
}
```

This kind of syntax is not possible when using JavaScript objects. So in StyleX
you can use the `firstThatWorks` function to achieve the same thing.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  header: {
    position: stylex.firstThatWorks('sticky', '-webkit-sticky', 'fixed'),
  },
});
```

## Keyframe animations

You can use the `stylex.keyframes()` function to define keyframe animations.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const fadeIn = stylex.keyframes({
  from: {opacity: 0},
  to: {opacity: 1},
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    animationName: fadeIn,
    animationDuration: '1s',
  },
});
```

## Dynamic styles

:::warning Use Sparingly

Dynamic styles are an advanced feature and should be used sparingly. For the
majority of use-cases,
[conditional styles](./02-using-styles.mdx#conditional-styles) should be
sufficient.

:::

StyleX generates all styles at compile-time which means you need to _know_ all
those styles ahead of time as well. But sometimes you just don't know what you
will need until runtime.

For such situations, you can define your styles as a function instead of an object
and pass in the dynamic components of the needed styles as parameters.

**NOTE**: The function body _must_ be an object literal. You cannot use a
function body with multiple statements.


```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  bar: (height) => ({
    height,
  }),
});

function MyComponent() {
  // The value of `height` cannot be known at compile time.
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(10);

  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.bar(height))} />;
}
```

Behind the scenes, StyleX will generate static styles that depend on a CSS variable
and set the value of that variable at runtime. This means, that any part of your
styles can be dynamic, including within Media Queries and pseudo-classes.
