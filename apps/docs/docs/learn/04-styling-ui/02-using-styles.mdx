# Using styles

Once styles have been defined, they can be converted to props that can be spread
on HTML elements using the [`stylex.props`](../../api/javascript/props.mdx) function. The `stylex.props` function
sets the appropriate `className` prop on the HTML element and, when using
[dynamic styles](/docs/learn/styling-ui/defining-styles/#dynamic-styles), the
`style` prop.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.props(styles.base)} />
```

While this is the simplest case, it is trivial to merge multiple style objects,
use them conditionally, or even compose styles across module boundaries.

:::tip For Solid, Svelte, Qwik, Vue, & others: `stylex.attrs`

For frameworks that expect `class` instead of `className`, use [`style.attrs`](../../api/javascript/attrs.mdx) instead.
The usage is otherwise identical to `stylex.props`.

`stylex.attrs` also converts any `style` value to a string, which is useful for
server-side rendering and frameworks that don't accept objects for `style`.

:::

## Merging styles

The `stylex.props` function can take a list of styles and merge them in a
deterministic way, where “the last style applied always wins”.

Consider that a couple of style objects are defined as so:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: 'grey',
  },
  highlighted: {
    color: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});

<div {...stylex.props(styles.base, styles.highlighted)} />;
```

The resulting HTML element will have purple text, because that style was applied
last. Instead, if the order of the styles were reversed, the text would be gray.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.props(styles.highlighted, styles.base)} />
```

**Note:** The order in which the styles are defined does not affect the
resulting styles, only the order in which they are applied to the HTML element.

:::info Like `Object.assign`

A simple way to think about the `stylex.props` function is that it does what
`Object.assign` does. It merges many objects and the later objects have
precedence over previous objects.

The actual implementation is optimized for performance.

:::

## Conditional styles

Styles can be applied conditionally at runtime by using common JavaScript
patterns such as ternary expressions and the `&&` operator. `stylex.props`
ignores falsy values such as `null`, `undefined` or `false`.

```tsx
<div
  {...stylex.props(
    styles.base,
    props.isHighlighted && styles.highlighted,
    isActive ? styles.active : styles.inactive,
  )}
/>
```

## Style variants

A common styling pattern called "variants" lets you apply one of a list of
possible styles based on the value of the prop named `variant`. StyleX supports this pattern without an additional API. Instead, an object property lookup can be used to achieve the same result.

First, each variant can be defined with the appropriate variant name for the style object.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  violet: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'blueviolet',
      ':hover': 'darkviolet',
    },
    color: 'white',
  },
  gray: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'gainsboro',
      ':hover': 'lightgray',
    },
  },
  // ... more variants here ...
});
```

Then, the appropriate styles can be applied by using the variant prop as a key
on the `styles` object.

```tsx
function Button({variant, ...props}) {
  return <button {...props} {...stylex.props(styles[variant])} />;
}
```

## Styles as props

Although StyleX encourages co-locating styles, it is possible to pass and use
styles across file and component boundaries. It is idiomatic to pass override
styles to a component as props.

### Passing style props to components

```tsx
<CustomComponent style={styles.base} />
```

:::warning

The `stylex.props` functions returns an object with `className` and `style`.
Don't use it when the styles are to be merged within a component.

```tsx
// NO!
<CustomComponent style={stylex.props(styles.base)} />
```

:::

Multiple style objects, including conditional styles, can be passed in
using an array literal:

```tsx
<CustomComponent style={[styles.base, isHighlighted && styles.highlighted]} />
```

:::info Prop names are arbitrary

`style` is an arbitrary prop name. You can choose your own prop names for your
codebase.

:::

### Accepting styles in components

Accepting custom `StyleXStyles` is as simple as accepting any other prop. and
applying it with the `stylex.props` function. Just like local styles.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

// Local Styles
const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    /*...*/
  },
});

function CustomComponent({style}) {
  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.base, style)} />;
}
```

It is idiomatic to apply styles passed in as props after the local styles. This
convention makes design system components predictable to use and easy to
customize.

## “Unsetting” styles

Sometimes, styles need to be removed rather than applied. While, CSS provides
values such as `initial`, `inherit`, `unset`, and `revert`, the simplest
solution to do this in StyleX is to set the value to `null`.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    color: null,
  },
});
```

Setting a style property to `null` removes any previously applied style for it
by StyleX.
