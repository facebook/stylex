# Types for Variables

:::info Note

The [`unstable_moduleResolution`](/docs/api/configuration/babel-plugin/#unstable_moduleresolution)
option needs to be enabled in the StyleX Babel configuration to enable theming APIs.

:::warning Advanced use-cases

Declaring types for variables is an advanced use-case. It is not necessary for
the majority of use-cases.

:::

By default, variables values are strings. This is the correct choice for the
majority of use-cases. However, modern browsers support defining types for CSS
variables. A variable can be declared with an `@property` rule that specifies
the `<syntax>` type of the variable.

Doing so can enable some interesting use-cases that would otherwise not be possible
with CSS. Some examples include:
- Animating gradients by animating an angle or color variables
- Capturing the value of `1em` on an element and using it on a descendant
- Converting a floating point number to an integer

## API

To assign types to variables in StyleX, you can use the various functions, such
as `stylex.types.color` or `stylex.types.length`.

Reference the [API documentation](../../api/javascript/types.mdx) for a full list of available functions.

## Usage

To assign types to variables, the value of the variable can be wrapped in
with the appropriate type function.

For example, consider the following set of variables:

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const tokens = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: 'black',
  secondaryText: '#333',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  angle: '0deg',
  int: '2',
});
```

Currently, all the values can be arbitrary strings. To assign types to the
variables, they can be wrapped with the appropriate type function:

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const tokens = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: stylex.types.color('black'),
  secondaryText: stylex.types.color('#333'),
  borderRadius: stylex.types.length('4px'),
  angle: stylex.types.angle('0deg'),
  int: stylex.types.integer(2),
});
```

### Conditional Values

The usage remains unchanged even when at-rules are used within the values.
The following is completely valid:

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const colors = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: stylex.types.color({default: 'black', [DARK]: 'white'}),
});
```

## Type-safety in your source code

The primary utility of `stylex.types.*` functions is to enable functionality
by declaring types for variables in the generated CSS. However, the StyleX API
also enhances the type-safety within your own codebase.

When a variable is declared with a certain type within `stylex.defineVars`, the
static types will enforce that the same type function is used when the variable
is themed within a `stylex.createTheme` call.


```tsx title="theme.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {tokens} from './tokens.stylex.js';

export const highContrast = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: stylex.types.color('black'),
  secondaryText: stylex.types.color('#222'),
  borderRadius: stylex.types.length('8px'),
  angle: stylex.types.angle('0deg'),
  int: stylex.types.integer(4),
});
```

Since the types for the variables are already declared within the `stylex.defineVars`
call, the usage type functions within `stylex.createTheme` is functionally a no-op, but
is required by the static types for type-safety.

## Example use-cases

### Simulating [`round()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round)

Modern browsers are starting to support
the [`round()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/round) function in CSS. 
However, the feature can be simulated with a variable with an `integer` type:

```tsx
const styles = stylex.create({
  gradient: {
    // Math.floor
    [tokens.int]: `calc(16 / 9)`

    // Math.round
    [tokens.int]: `calc((16 / 9) + 0.5)`
  },
})
```

Since `tokens.int` is declared with an `integer` type, any fractional
value is discarded and the value is cast into an integer type whenever
a value is assigned.


### Animating gradients

It is usually not possible to animate gradients. However, by using a typed
`angle` variable, the gradient can be animated by animating the angle used
within it.

Instead of animating a *normal* CSS property, the `angle` variable can be
animated with `stylex.keyframes`:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {tokens} from './tokens.stylex';

const rotate = stylex.keyframes({
  from: { [tokens.angle]: '0deg' },
  to: { [tokens.angle]: '360deg' },
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  gradient: {
    backgroundImage: `conic-gradient(from ${tokens.angle}, ...colors)`,
    animationName: rotate,
    animationDuration: '10s',
    animationTimingFunction: 'linear',
    animationIterationCount: 'infinite',
  },
})
```

This can be used to create rotating conic gradients:

import AnimatedGradientBox from '../../../components/AnimatedGradientBox/AnimatedGradientBox';

<AnimatedGradientBox />
