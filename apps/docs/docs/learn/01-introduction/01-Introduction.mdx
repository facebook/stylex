# Introduction to StyleX

StyleX is a simple, easy to use JavaScript syntax and compiler for styling web
apps.

StyleX combines the strengths and avoids the weaknesses of both inline styles
and static CSS. Defining and using styles requires only local knowledge within a
component, and avoids specificity issues while retaining features like Media
Queries. StyleX builds optimized styles using collision-free atomic CSS which is
superior to what could be authored and maintained by hand.

## Features at a glance

### Predictable

- Style Encapsulation - All styles are caused by class names applied directly set
  on an element
- No specificity issues
- “The last style applied always wins!”

### Scalable

- Minimize CSS output with atomic CSS
- The CSS size plateaus even as the number of components grows
- Styles remain readable and maintainable within growing codebases

### Flexible & Composable

- Apply styles conditionally
- Merge and compose arbitrary styles across component and file boundaries
- Use local constants and expressions to keep your styles DRY
  - Or repeat yourself without worrying about performance

### Static & Fast

- No runtime style injections
- All styles are bundled in a static CSS file at compile-time
- Optimized runtime for merging class names

### Type-Safe

- Type-safe APIs
- Type-safe styles
- Type-safe theming
- Type-safe style props

## Ideal conditions for using StyleX?

StyleX works well in a wide variety of projects, and you will usually not regret
choosing it. However, there are some conditions that are more ideal for using StyleX than
others.

### When authoring your UI in JavaScript

StyleX is a CSS-in-JS library, which means that it is most useful when you are
authoring your UI in JavaScript. If you're using a framework such as React,
Preact, Solid, lit-html, or Angular, using StyleX should be a breeze.

Some frameworks, such as Svelte and Vue use custom file formats that are
compiled to JavaScript at build time. StyleX can still be used in these
frameworks, but may need some extra configuration.

There are also UI solutions such as `htmx` and various templating engines where
you author your markup in files that can't contain arbitrary JavaScript. Even if
you can make StyleX work in these environments, it may not be worth the effort.

### Large or growing projects

While StyleX works well for projects of all sizes, it really shines in larger
applications.

Since StyleX compiles to atomic class names, a big performance benefit is that
the size of your CSS bundle plateaus as your project grows.

For smaller projects, it may still make sense to choose StyleX for its
expressive API, but the performance benefits may not be as meaningful.

### Reusable components

StyleX makes the most sense when being used alongside reusable UI components.

For years, we have had to choose between "Design System" components that come
with styles baked in but can be difficult to customize or "Headless" components
that are completely unstyled.

StyleX finally lets you build UI components that can have default styles _and_
still be customizable.

Further, the consistency enables sharing these components by publishing them to
NPM. As long as the consumer of your component is also using StyleX, the styles
will be merged and composed correctly without any additional configuration.
