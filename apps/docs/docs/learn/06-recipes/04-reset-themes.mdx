# Reset Theme

The `stylex.defineVars` function is used to create a set of CSS variables,
called `VarGroup`s. Further, the `stylex.createTheme` function can be used to create 
`Theme`s, that override the values of the variables defined within `VarGroup`s.

Many `VarGroup`s can be defined which can then be independently overridden with `Theme`s.
However, `Theme`s for the *same* `VarGroup` are mutually exclusive and do not merge.
Any variable in a `VarGroup` that is not explicitly overridden in a `Theme` for that `VarGroup`
is set to its default value.

This characteristic of `Theme`s can be used to define a "empty" theme that resets all variables
to their default values.

## Example

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import { vars } from './variables.stylex';

export const resetVars = stylex.createTheme(vars, {});
```
