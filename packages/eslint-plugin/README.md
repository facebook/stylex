# @stylexjs/eslint-plugin

The ESLint rule is a standalone ESLint plugin that mostly maintains an `allowlist` for valid styles and their valid values.

This was originally created from Flow types which is why it's currently not very powerful.

## Installation

```sh
npm install --save-dev @stylexjs/eslint-plugin
```

## Enable Flow Types

If you need to import this package in an environment where you need the Flow type definitions
shipped with this package to work, please add the following options to your `.flowconfig` file:

```
module.system.node.resolve_dirname=flow_modules
module.system.node.resolve_dirname=node_modules
```
This will fix the missing types for `eslint` and `estree`.

## Enabling the plugin and rules

Once you've installed the npm package you can enable the plugin and rules by opening your ESLint configuration file and adding the plugin and rules.

``` json
{
  "rules": {
    "stylex/valid-styles": "error"
  },
  "plugins": ["stylex"]
}
```

## All the rules

### stylex/valid-styles

StyleX requires styles that are statically analyzable. This rule will detect invalid styles that stylex cannot handle.
