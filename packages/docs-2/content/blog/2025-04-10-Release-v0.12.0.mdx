# Release 0.12.0

StyleX v0.12.0 introduces performance optimizations, several bug fixes, a new lint rule, and some cleanup of deprecated packages.

## Performance

### Object key minification

The keys of compiled style objects are now minified to reduce overall code size.

### Faster theme compilation

Compiling `createTheme` calls is now several orders of magnitude faster. This was achieved by caching evaluated theme objects.

## ESLint improvements

### New `no-legacy-contextual-styles` rule

A new rule has been added to the StyleX ESLint plugin to flag uses of the deprecated media query and pseudo-class syntax. This rule flags usage of the legacy media query and pseudo-class syntax that wraps multiple property values inside a single `@`-rule or pseudo-class block. This pattern is deprecated and should be replaced with the updated syntax [here](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/styling-ui/defining-styles/#media-queries-and-other--rules). (Thanks [vincentriemer](https://github.com/vincentriemer)!)

## Bug fixes

### Styling pseudo-elements in dynamic styles

Dynamic styles can now be used to style pseudo-elements. Previously, the generated CSS variables could not be inherited by pseudo-elements.

### Disallow object spreads in `create`

Object spreading in `create` calls is now disallowed by the compiler, as this breaks runtime caching of style merging.

## Deprecations

The following bundler integration packages have been deprecated. We're focusing development on the core StyleX toolchain, and providing consistent tools for use across different bundlers. We recommend using the [`@stylexjs/postcss-plugin`](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/configuration/postcss-plugin/).

- `@stylexjs/esbuild-plugin`
- `@stylexjs/nextjs-plugin`
- `@stylexjs/webpack-plugin`

The [`@stylexjs/rollup-plugin`](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/tree/main/packages/rollup-plugin) remains, but may be generalized into an `unplugin` package to extend this option to other bundlers.

The following other packages have also been deprecated.

- `@stylexjs/dev-runtime`
- `@stylexjs/open-props` (replacement available at [`stylextras/open-props`](https://github.com/nmn/stylextras/tree/main/packages/open-props))
