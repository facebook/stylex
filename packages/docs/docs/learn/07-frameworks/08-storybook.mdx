# Storybook (Vite builder)

[`examples/example-storybook`](../../../../examples/example-storybook) shows
how to document StyleX components in Storybook using the Vite builder. The
StyleX PostCSS plugin extracts CSS from the stories and writes it into
Storybook’s CSS asset.

## Install

```bash
npm install -D @stylexjs/postcss-plugin
```

## PostCSS configuration

Add the StyleX PostCSS plugin and point it at your stories:

```js
// postcss.config.mjs
import stylex from '@stylexjs/postcss-plugin';
import nesting from 'postcss-nesting';
import autoprefixer from 'autoprefixer';

export default {
  plugins: [
    nesting,
    stylex({
      include: ['stories/**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
      useCSSLayers: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
    }),
    autoprefixer,
  ],
};
```

Storybook’s Vite builder picks up this config automatically. During dev the
plugin injects generated CSS; for static builds it appends to the emitted CSS
file.

## Storybook config

The example uses `@storybook/react-vite` with a custom Vite config
(`vite-storybook.config.ts`) that already enables React and TypeScript. No
additional StyleX-specific Vite plugins are required when using the PostCSS
pipeline.

## Run

- `npm run storybook` — start Storybook with live StyleX extraction.
- `npm run build-storybook` — produce a static Storybook that includes the
  compiled StyleX CSS.
