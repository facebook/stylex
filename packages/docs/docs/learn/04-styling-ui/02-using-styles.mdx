# Using styles

Once styles have been defined, they must be converted to `className` and
`styles` props that can be spread on HTML elements using the
[`props`](../../api/javascript/props.mdx) function.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.props(styles.base)} />
```

While this is the simplest case, it is trivial to merge multiple style objects,
use them conditionally, or even compose styles across module boundaries.

## Merging styles

The `props` function can take a list of styles and merge them in a
deterministic way, where the last style applied always wins. The order in which
the styles are defined does not affect the resulting styles, only the order in
which they are applied to the HTML element.

Using `props` is only required when styles are set on React
DOM host elements like `<div>`.

Consider styles that are defined as follows:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    fontSize: 16,
    lineHeight: 1.5,
    color: 'grey',
  },
  highlighted: {
    color: 'rebeccapurple',
  },
});

<div {...stylex.props(styles.base, styles.highlighted)} />;
```

The resulting HTML element will have purple text, because that style was applied
last. If instead the order of the styles were reversed, the text would be gray.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.props(styles.highlighted, styles.base)} />
```

A simple way to think about the `props` function is that merges many
objects and the later objects have precedence over previous objects.

Each individual style object can be passed to `props` as a separate
argument, or passed in as an array of styles.

```tsx
<div {...stylex.props([styles.base, styles.highlighted])} />
```

## Conditional styles

Styles can be applied conditionally at runtime using common JavaScript
patterns such as ternary expressions and the `&&` operator. `props`
ignores falsy values such as `null`, `undefined`, or `false`.

```tsx
<div
  {...stylex.props(
    styles.base,
    props.isHighlighted && styles.highlighted,
    isActive ? styles.active : styles.inactive,
  )}
/>
```

## Style variants

A common styling pattern called "variants" lets you apply styles based on the
value of a specific prop, e.g., `variant`. StyleX supports this pattern without
an additional API. Instead, an object property lookup can be used to achieve
the same result.

First, each variant can be defined with the appropriate variant name for the
style object.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  violet: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'blueviolet',
      ':hover': 'darkviolet',
    },
    color: 'white',
  },
  gray: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'gainsboro',
      ':hover': 'lightgray',
    },
  },
  // ... more variants here ...
});
```

The appropriate styles can then be applied by using the `variant` prop as a key
on the `styles` object.

```tsx
function Button({variant, ...props}) {
  return <button {...props} {...stylex.props(styles[variant])} />;
}
```

## Styles as props

StyleX encourages co-locating styles, but it's also possible to pass and use
styles across file and component boundaries using component props.

### Passing style props to components

When using custom components, styles created with StyleX can be passed down
as props.

```tsx
<CustomComponent style={styles.base} />
```

StyleX will correctly merge nested arrays of styles, which means you can use
the same patterns described above to combine or conditionally apply styles.

```tsx
<CustomComponent style={[styles.base, isHighlighted && styles.highlighted]} />
```

When combining local styles with styles passed in as props, it's idiomatic to
apply the styles passed in as props *after* the local styles. Although, there's
nothing wrong with applying certain local styles last, if you require them to
always take priority over prop styles.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: { /*...*/ }
});

function CustomComponent({style}) {
  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.base, style)} />;
}
```

In these examples the `style` prop name is arbitrary. You can use any prop
name, just like when passing any other types of data to React components.

## “Unsetting” styles

Sometimes, styles need to be removed rather than applied. While CSS provides
values such as `initial`, `inherit`, `unset`, and `revert`, the simplest
solution to do this in StyleX is to set the value to `null`.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  base: {
    color: null
  },
});
```

Setting a style property to `null` removes any previously applied style for it
by StyleX. And it doesn't result in additional generated CSS.
