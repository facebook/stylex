# CLI

Use the StyleX CLI to compile `.stylex.ts(x)` files ahead-of-time without a
bundler. When the other integrations don't work, you can use the CLI to transform
a folder of files into a folder where the StyleX APIs have been compiled away and
a single CSS bundle has been generated.

The CLI does insert an import for the generated CSS file into every file that was transformed,
so it assumed your bundler is able to handle CSS imports.

[`example-cli`](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/tree/main/examples/example-cli) in
the StyleX repository shows a minimal setup example.

## Install

import {DevInstallExample} from '../../../components/examples/dev-install';

<DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/cli`]} />

Add any Babel presets you need (for example
`@babel/preset-typescript`/`@babel/preset-react`) to match your source syntax.

## Configure `.stylex.json5`

Create a `.stylex.json` or `.stylex.json5` file in the project root. (JSON5 is
a more flexible and readable configuration format that allows comments, trailing commas etc.)

```js
{
  input: ['./source'],           // Where your StyleX source lives
  output: ['./src'],             // Where compiled files + CSS bundle are written
  cssBundleName: 'stylex_bundle.css',
  babelPresets: [
    ['@babel/preset-typescript', { allExtensions: true, isTSX: true }],
  ],
  styleXConfig: {
    aliases: {
      '@/*': ['./source/*'],
    },
  },
  // watch: true, // enable for incremental rebuilds
}
```

- `input`/`output` define the compile roots (the example copies `source` to
  `src`).
- `cssBundleName` controls the emitted CSS filename that you can import from
  your app shell.
- `styleXConfig` mirrors the options for `@stylexjs/babel-plugin`.

## Build and consume CSS

Run the compiler with:

```bash
npx stylex --config .stylex.json5
```

Use `--watch` for incremental rebuilds.
