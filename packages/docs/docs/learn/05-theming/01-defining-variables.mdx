# Defining variables

:::info Note

The [`unstable_moduleResolution`](/docs/api/configuration/babel-plugin/#unstable_moduleresolution)
option needs to be enabled in the StyleX Babel configuration to enable theming APIs.

:::

In addition to authoring styles for your components that generate atomic styles,
StyleX also has APIs for defining CSS Custom Properties (CSS variables) in a
reliable, predictable and type-safe way.

### Design Inspiration

The design of the theming APIs in StyleX are directly inspired by React's
Context APIs. Variables are defined with default values similar to how React
Contexts are created, and themes can be created to “provide” different values
for these variables for UI sub-trees.

## Defining Variables

A group of variables are defined using the `defineVars` function:

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const tokens = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: 'black',
  secondaryText: '#333',
  accent: 'blue',
  background: 'white',
  lineColor: 'gray',
  borderRadius: '4px',
  fontFamily: 'system-ui, sans-serif',
  fontSize: '16px',
});
```

This function, too, is processed at compile-time and unique CSS variable names are
automatically generated.

This defines the variables at `:root` of the HTML document. They can be imported
as constants and used within `create` calls.

### Using Media Queries

Variables values can vary based on a media queries:

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

// A constant can be used to avoid repeating the media query
const DARK = '@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)';

export const colors = stylex.defineVars({
  primaryText: {default: 'black', [DARK]: 'white'},
  secondaryText: {default: '#333', [DARK]: '#ccc'},
  accent: {default: 'blue', [DARK]: 'lightblue'},
  background: {default: 'white', [DARK]: 'black'},
  lineColor: {default: 'gray', [DARK]: 'lightgray'},
});
```

Similarly, `@supports` can be used as well.

### Manual Variable Names

The `defineVars` function lets you use treat variables as typical javascript objects.
Behind the scenes, StyleX will generate unique and deterministic variable names based
on the file name, variable name bound to `defineVars` and the key within the object.

However, there cases where you may want to manually specify the variable name.
This done by using strings that start with `--` as the object keys within your `defineVars` call.

```tsx title="tokens.stylex.js"
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const tokens = stylex.defineVars({
  '--primaryText': 'black',
  '--secondaryText': '#333',
  '--accent': 'blue',
});
```

This call will use the exact strings as variable names in the generated CSS:
`--primaryText`, `--secondaryText`, `--accent`.

:::warning Ensure Uniqueness

When using manual variable names, StyleX can no longer ensure that your variable
names are globally unique. You will have to ensure that no two variable declarations
with `defineVars` define the same manual variable name.

:::

Other than the name of the CSS variable in the generated CSS, these variables work
just like any other variables defined with `defineVars`.

## Rules when defining variable names 

Variables are the only type of non-local value that can be used within a
`create` call. This is made possible by enforcing a few rules:

#### 1. Variables must be defined in `.stylex.js` files

Variables must be in a file with one of the following extensions:

1. `.stylex.js`
2. `.stylex.mjs`
3. `.stylex.cjs`
4. `.stylex.ts`
5. `.stylex.tsx`
6. `.stylex.jsx`

#### 2. Variables must be named exports

Every `defineVars` call _must_ be a named export.

##### Allowed:

```tsx
// ✅ - Named export
export const colors = stylex.defineVars({
  /* ... */
});

const sizeVars = { ... };
// ✅ - Another Named export
export const sizes = stylex.defineVars(sizeVars);
```

##### Not Allowed:

```tsx
// ❌ - Only named exports are allowed
export default stylex.defineVars({
  /* ... */
});

// ❌ - The variable must be exported directly
const x = stylex.defineVars({
  /* ... */
});
export const colors = x;

// ❌ - The variables cannot be nested within another object
export const colors = {
  foregrounds: stylex.defineVars({
    /* ... */
  }),
  backgrounds: stylex.defineVars({
    /* ... */
  }),
};
```

#### 3. No other exports are allowed in the file

For now, `.stylex.js` files are exclusively for defining CSS variables.
