# `VarGroup<>`

```tsx
type VarGroup<Tokens extends {}>
```

A `VarGroup` is the type of the object that is generated as a result of calling
[`defineVars`](../javascript/defineVars.mdx). It maps keys to references
to CSS custom properties.

`VarGroup` is also the required type for the first argument to
[`createTheme`](../javascript/createTheme.mdx)

Usually, `VarGroup` is not needed explicitly, as it can be
inferred from the argument to `defineVars`.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const vars = stylex.defineVars({
  color: 'red',
  backgroundColor: 'blue',
});

export type Vars = typeof vars;
/*
  Vars = VarGroup<{
    color: string,
    backgroundColor: string,
  }>
*/
```

In some cases, however, `VarGroup` may be needed explicitly, to
constrain the values of the variables within themes:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import type {VarGroup} from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const vars: VarGroup<{
  color: 'red' | 'blue' | 'green' | 'yellow',
  backgroundColor: 'red' | 'blue' | 'green' | 'yellow',
}> = stylex.defineVars({
  color: 'red',
  backgroundColor: 'blue',
});
```

Now when a theme for `vars` is being created, the values for `color` and `backgroundColor`
can only be one of the specified values.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {vars} from './vars.stylex';

export const theme1 = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  color: 'red', // OK
  backgroundColor: 'blue', // OK
});

export const theme2 = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  // Error: 'orange' is not assignable to 'red' | 'blue' | 'green' | 'yellow'
  color: 'orange',
});
```

While, it's not needed in most cases, `VarGroup` also accepts an optional second type type argument.

    <strong>
      Advanced use-case: unique type identity for a `VarGroup`
    </strong>
  </p>
</summary>

TypeScript (and Flow) use structural typing, which means that two objects with the same
shape are considered to be the same type. However, each usage of `defineVars` results
in a new set of variables.

It can be useful to have a unique type identity for each `VarGroup` created to be able to
distinguish between them and accept themes for only a specific `VarGroup`. This is also
known as "nominal typing" and can be achieved by using a unique symbol as the second type
argument to `VarGroup`.

The complete type signature of `VarGroup` is:

```tsx
type VarGroup<Tokens extends {}, ID extends symbol = symbol>
```

It can be used like this:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import type {VarGroup} from '@stylexjs/stylex';

type Shape = {
  color: string,
  backgroundColor: string,
};

declare const BaseColors: unique symbol;
export const baseColors: VarGroup<Shape, typeof BaseColors> =
  stylex.defineVars({
    color: 'red',
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  });

declare const CardColors: unique symbol;
export const cardColors: VarGroup<Shape, typeof CardColors> =
  stylex.defineVars({
    color: 'red',
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  });
```

Here `baseColors` and `cardColors` are `VarGroup` objects of the same shape, but with two
distinct type identities. This ensures that a `Theme` for one can't be used with the other.

It should be rare that two separate `VarGroup` objects are defined with the same shape
and so this feature is not needed in most cases. In the rare cases where it *is*
needed, it is available.
