# `stylex.viewTransitionClass`

Creates a set of `::view-transition` pseudo-element rules tied to a single class name which can be utilized for customizing the animations in a [View Transition](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API).

:::note

The styles that `viewTransitionClass` accepts don't currently support media queries but adding support for them is a planned enhancement.

:::

```ts
type ViewTransitionClassOptions = Readonly<{
  group?: RawStyles,
  imagePair?: RawStyles,
  old?: RawStyles,
  new?: RawStyles,
}>;
function viewTransitionClass(options: ViewTransitionClassOptions): string;
```

The options object the `viewTransitionClass` function takes in accepts the following keys which map to a corresponding View Transition pseudo-element:

* `group` -> `::view-transition-group(*.theGeneratedClass)`
* `imagePair` -> `::view-transition-image-pair(*.theGeneratedClass)`
* `old` -> `::view-transition-old(*.theGeneratedClass)`
* `new` -> `::view-transition-new(*.theGeneratedClass)`

This method returns the generated class name as a string which can be added manually to the elements you want animations customized for, or if you're using React can be passed into the experimental [`<ViewTransition />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) component.

### Example use:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import { unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition } from 'react';

const lingeringOldView = stylex.viewTransitionClass({
  new: {
    animationDuration: '1s',
  },
  old: {
    animationDuration: '2s',
  },
});

<ViewTransition default={lingeringOldView}>
  {/* ... */}
</ViewTransition>
```

`viewTransitionClass` calls can also accept [`keyframes`](keyframes.mdx) output to customize the animations even further:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const fadeInUp = stylex.keyframes({
  from: {
    opacity: 0,
    transform: 'translateY(-30px)'
  },
  to: {
    opacity: 1,
    transform: 'translateY(0px)'
  },
});

const transitionCls = stylex.viewTransitionClass({
  new: {
    animationName: fadeInUp,
  },
});
```
