# Release 0.12.0

StyleX v0.12.0 introduces performance optimizations, several bug fixes, a new lint rule, and some cleanup of deprecated packages.

## Performance

### Hashing Style Object Keys

We added a new config option to minify keys in compiled style objects to reduce overall code size. To enable, turn on `enableMinifyKeys` within your project's `.babelrc` file.

### `stylex.createTheme` object caching

We've made significant improvements to compilation time by caching evaluated theme objects (up to 3000x faster in certain object patterns!).

## ESLint improvements

### New `no-legacy-media-queries` rule

A new rule has been added to the StyleX ESLint plugin to flag deprecated media query and pseudoclass syntax. This rule flags usage of the legacy media query and pseudoclass syntax that wraps multiple property values inside a single @-rule or pseudoclass block. This pattern is deprecated and should be replaced with the updated syntax [here](https://stylexjs.com/docs/learn/styling-ui/defining-styles/#media-queries-and-other--rules). (Thanks [vincentriemer](https://github.com/vincentriemer)!)

## Bug fixes

### Pseudo-elements in dynamic styles

Fixed a bug where styling on pseudo-elements was not set correctly in dynamic styles.

### Disallowed Spreads in `stylex.create`

Weâ€™ve disallowed object spreading in `stylex.create` calls for planned runtime optimizations around style merging.

## Deprecations

We're deprecating the following packages because maintaining high-quality support across multiple build tools isn't sustainable. Instead, we're focusing on the core StyleX toolchain and moving to community maintained plugins to provide and facilitate integrations.

- `@stylexjs/dev-runtime`
- `@stylexjs/esbuild-plugin`
- `@stylexjs/nextjs-plugin`
- `@stylexjs/open-props` (replacement available at [`stylextras/open-props`](https://github.com/nmn/stylextras/tree/main/packages/open-props))
- `@stylexjs/webpack-plugin`

We recommend using the [`@stylexjs/postcss-plugin`](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/configuration/postcss-plugin/) or the [`@stylexjs/rollup-plugin`](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/tree/main/packages/rollup-plugin) for integration instead.
