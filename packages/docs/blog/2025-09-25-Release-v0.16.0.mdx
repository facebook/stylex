# Release 0.16.0

This release adds support for a long-requested feature—descendant and sibling selectors! We've also expanded `defineConsts` capabilities, improved our lint rules, added a webpack example, and made some performance optimizations.

## Descendant and sibling selectors

We’re adding a new suite of APIs under `stylex.when` with support for descendant and sibling selectors: `ancestor`, `descendant`, `anySibling`, `siblingBefore`, and `siblingAfter`.
- Ancestor/descendant (`stylex.when.ancestor` and `stylex.when.descendant`) selectors let you style an element based on the state of ancestors or descendants in the DOM tree.
- Sibling selectors (`stylex.when.anySibling`, `stylex.when.siblingBefore` and `stylex.when.siblingAfter`) let you style an element based on the state of adjacent siblings.

To use descendant and sibling selectors, you'll need to mark the element being observed by passing the `stylex.defaultMarker` class name. Support for custom markers will be added in a future release.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
    foo: {
      backgroundColor: {
        default: 'blue',
        [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover')]: 'red',
      },
    },
});

<div {...stylex.props(stylex.defaultMarker())}>
  <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo)}> Some Content </div>
</div>
```

Note: Lookahead selectors like `stylex.when.siblingAfter`, `stylex.when.anySibling`, and `stylex.when.descendant` rely on the CSS `has()` selector, which does not yet have [widespread browser support](https://caniuse.com/css-has).

## `defineConsts` improvements

We’ve added support for overriding `defineConsts` constants that reference CSS variables (`var(--*)`) when set to variables and variable fallbacks. Constants now behave like passthroughs, with overrides applying to the original CSS variable. This allows you to re-define them within `create` calls as you would for `defineVars`.

```tsx
export const colors = stylex.defineConsts({
  bg: "var(--background-color)",
  accent: "var(--accent, lightblue)",
});

import {colors} from "./colors.stylex.js";
const styles = stylex.create({
  root: {
    [colors.bg]: "red",
    [colors.accent]: "darkblue",
  },
});
```

We've also added support for `defineConsts` in dynamic styles. You can now use `defineConsts` to declare media queries within dynamic styles as you would in regular StyleX namespaces.

```tsx
const style = stylex.create({
  main: (height) => ({
    color: {
      default: colors.red,
      [breakpoints.sm]: colors.blue,
      [breakpoints.md]: colors.yellow,
    },
    height: height - 10,
  }),
});
```

## Linter improvements

We made several improvements and lint fixes to the `valid-styles` rule. The `valid-styles` rule now has support for locally resolved constants.

```tsx
const HEIGHT = 5;

const styles = stylex.create({
  default: {
    scrollMarginTop: HEIGHT + 5,
    scrollMarginBottom: HEIGHT * 5,
  },
});
```

We added linter support for setting CSS custom properties within `create` calls. (Thanks [@dwei-figma](https://github.com/dwei-figma)!)

```tsx
const styles = stylex.create({
  default: {
    --background-color: 'red',
  },
});
```

We also added support for positionTry styles (Thanks [@abhakat](https://github.com/abhakat)!), better validation for pseudo-elements (Thanks [@dwrth](https://github.com/dwrth)!), migrated object type validation to Flow (Thanks [@jcperez-ch](https://github.com/jcperez-ch)!), and of 0 values as strings ('0') for length properties.

## Bug fixes

- Fixed class name construction for dynamic contextual styles.
- Reduced chances of dynamic variable name collisions. (Thanks [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas)!)

## Miscellaneous

- A [webpack example](https://stylex.org/playground/) was added to our suite of StyleX example integrations! (Thanks [@RavenColEvol](https://github.com/RavenColEvol)!)
- Support to hoist `stylex.create` and nested objects within functions.
- Optimized precomputed props calls in JSX. (Thanks [@necolas](https://github.com/necolas)!)
- More efficient handling of null/undefined in dynamic styles.
