Happy new year! We are excited to announce the release of StyleX v0.10.0, which includes several new features and improvements.

## Easier adoption with the all-new PostCSS plugin

StyleX now ships with an all-new PostCSS plugin. This plugin allows you to use StyleX with any PostCSS-compatible toolchain,
to better integrate with existing projects. The PostCSS plugin is now our recommended approach for using StyleX
in a Next.js or Vite project. The example Next.js app in this repository has been updated to reflect this change. The existing 
`@stylexjs/nextjs-plugin` will be deprecated in the next release.

A huge thanks to [javascripter](https://github.com/javascripter/) for contributing this plugin.

## Better debugging

StyleX has a new `debug` option to enable more readable classNames and variable names during development.
With this option turned on, classNames will be prefixed with the affected CSS property and variables will
be prefixed with their key name in your source code. (Thanks [mellyeliu](https://github.com/mellyeliu/))

Additionally, the error messages of the StyleX Babel plugin have been improved to be more granular and
correctly highlight the location of the source code causing the error.

## ESLint improvements

### All new `no-unused` rule

The StyleX ESLint plugin now ships with a new `no-unused` rule that detects unused styles. (Thanks [Samantha-Zhan](https://github.com/Samantha-Zhan/))

### Other improvements

The `valid-styles` rule now offers more auto-fixes, and a small bug was fixed in the `valid-shorthands` rule.
(Thanks [mellyeliu](https://github.com/mellyeliu/))

## Theming now works without manually configuring `rootDir`

StyleX previously required manual configuration of `unstable_moduleResolution.rootDir` for enabling
the theming APIs. This is no longer the case. Additionally, compilation should be more reliable
and cache-friendly, especially when using package managers like `pnpm`.

## Performance improvements for Dynamic styles

StyleX uses CSS custom properties (aka CSS variables) as inline styles for dynamic values for styles.
In v0.10.0 StyleX now generates `@property` declarations marking these variables as non-inheritable.
This improves the style resolution performance of the browser's styling engine, which in some cases can
be quite significant. We have also updated our benchmarks to track the code size impact of this change.
(Thanks [Samantha-Zhan](https://github.com/Samantha-Zhan/))

## CLI improvements

### Caching

The StyleX CLI now uses a cache by default which ensures that only changed files are recompiled.
This cache is stored in the nearest `node_modules` folder and works even without using `watch` mode.
(Thanks [mellyeliu](https://github.com/mellyeliu/))

### Better interoperability

The CLI now supports configuring additional Babel presets and plugins that can run before the StyleX
plugin to let you use custom syntax transformations. The StyleX Babel plugin was also updated to make
this use-case more reliable.

### Windows support

A bug with file paths was fixed and the CLI should now work correctly on Windows.

## Documentation

We have introduced a new [Recipes](/docs/learn/recipes/variants/) section in the documentation to showcase some useful patterns when
using StyleX.

## Miscellaneous

- The StyleX Rollup plugin now supports generating filename hashes. (Thanks [nonzzz](https://github.com/nonzzz))
- We now use the `@dual-bundle/import-meta-resolve` package to replace `esm-resolve` which should making theming APIs more reliable. 
  (Thanks [p0nch000](https://github.com/p0nch000))
- Removed unnecessary quotes around 'content' values in CSS files. (Thanks [nikeee](https://github.com/nikeee))
- Added support for `view-transition-name` in ESLint's `valid-styles` rule.
- Added support for `interpolate-size` in ESLint's `valid-styles` rule.
