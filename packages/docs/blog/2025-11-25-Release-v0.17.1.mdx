# Release 0.17.1

StyleX v0.17 introduces an all new unplugin package for improved integration with various modern bundlers,
the ability to define custom markers to be be used alongside the `stylex.when.*` APIs, and a slew of bug-fixes
and improvements.

## New `@stylexjs/unplugin` package

Stylex 0.17 comes with a new `@stylexjs/unplugin` package that use the excellent `unplugin` library to create a near-universal bundler
plugin that works with Vite, Rollup, Webpack, Rspack, Esbuild, and more. In supported project setups, this new package should offer
the best developer experience and performance for StyleX integration. We have introduced new 
[examples](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/tree/main/examples) in the github repository for using
Webpack, RSPack and various Vite setups, (including RSCs, React-Router, Waky and RedwoodSDK). 
When applicable we are testing both production builds and HMR in development builds.

We look forward to expanding this set of examples with more common frameworks and bundler setups.

For frameworks that are not yet supported by our unplugin package, we continue to maintain the `@stylexjs/postcss-plugin` and 
and `@stylexjs/cli` packages for maximum compatibitiy.


## Custom Markers for `stylex.when.*` APIs

StyleX 0.16 introduced new set of APIs to observe the state of other elements:

- `stylex.when.ancestor(pseudo, marker?)`
- `stylex.when.descendant(pseudo, marker?)`
- `stylex.when.siblingBefore(pseudo, marker?)`
- `stylex.when.siblingAfter(pseudo, marker?)`
- `stylex.when.anySibling(pseudo, marker?)`
- `stylex.defaultMarker()`

StyleX 0.17 introduces one new API to create custom named markers, `stylex.defineMarker()`.

Using these APIs, a typical CSS selector such as `.parent:hover .child` can be implemented as:

import { Card } from '../components/StyleXWhenDemo/Card';

<Card />

```tsx
// markers.stylex.ts
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

export const cardMarker = stylex.defineMarker();
export const btn = stylex.defineMarker();
```

```tsx
// Card.tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import { cardMarker, btnMarker } from './markers.stylex';
import {tokens} from './tokens.stylex';

export function Card() {
  return (
    <article {...stylex.props(styles.card, cardMarker)}>
      <p>Markers let siblings and ancestors opt into the same state.</p>
      <button {...stylex.props(btnMarker, styles.cta)}>
        Action
        <ArrowIcon style={styles.icon} />
      </button>
    </article>
  );
}

const styles = stylex.create({
  card: {
    borderWidth: 1,
    borderStyle: 'solid',
    borderColor: tokens.borderColor,
  },
  cta: {
    backgroundColor: {
      default: 'black',
      [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover', cardMarker)]: tokens.accent,
    },
    color: 'white',
  },
  icon: {
    opacity: {
      default: 0,
      [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover', cardMarker)]: 1,
    },
    transform: {
      default: 'translateX(0)',
      [stylex.when.ancestor(':hover', btnMarker)]: 'translateX(4px)',
    }
  }
});
```

Icon in the button appears when card is hovered, but it moves to the right when the button itself is hovered.

## Updating default configuration options

We are updating some of the default StyleX configuration options to help make the builds more consistent across development
and production and improve the developer experience in many scenarios.

### `enableDebugClassNames` is now disabled by default

Enabling this option will emit classNames that reference the CSS property being applied, and CSS variable names 
that are prefixed with the name used in source. However, generating incompatible CSS in development and production
can cause caching-related bugs in some setups and so we are disabling this option by default.

### `data-style-src` prop now shows full file paths

The `data-style-src` prop is injected in addition to `className` and `style` during development to help identify the
list of style objects applied to to the element in order or application. Previously, it showed only the last two segments
of the file path which can be confusing.

Now, the it will include the full path relative to the nearest `package.json` file. For third-party package, we will also
include the package name itself.

### `enableDevClassNames` will now be enabled when `dev` is enabled

The `dev` option inserts additional classNames that help identify where various classNames are coming from.


## Other Improvements

- Added support for handling `defineConsts` correctly when runtime injection is enabled.
- Fixed a bug sometimes that caused invalid CSS output when Media Queries use `screen and` conditionals
- Dependency updates, including Jest, to pick up the latest fixes.
- Specificity improvements when using `stylex.when.*` selectors alongside regular pseudo-classes.
- Expand how often `stylex.props` is precompiled to improve performance.
- Various improvements to Flow and Typescript types (thanks, @j-malt, @henryqdineen)
- Various improvements and fixes to the ESlint plugin (thanks, @hiteshshetty-dev, @yjoer)
