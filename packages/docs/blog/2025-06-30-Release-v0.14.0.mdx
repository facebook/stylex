# Release 0.14.0

StyleX v0.14.0 introduces new APIs to the compiler and linter, as well as a couple of breaking changes to improve performance.

## New features

### Compiler: `viewTransitionClass`

The [`viewTransitionClass`](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/javascript/viewTransitionClass/) API allows you to use StyleX to customize your [CSS View Transitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/View_Transition_API). This API works nicely with Reactâ€™s new [`<ViewTransition />`](https://react.dev/reference/react/ViewTransition) component:

```tsx
import {unstable_ViewTransition as ViewTransition} from 'react';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const transitionClass = stylex.viewTransitionClass({
  old: {
    animationName: stylex.keyframes({ to: { opacity: 0 } }),
    animationTimingFunction: 'ease-out',
    animationDuration: '300ms',
  },
  new: {
    animationName: stylex.keyframes({ from: { opacity: 0 } }),
    animationTimingFunction: 'ease-out',
    animationDuration: '300ms',
  },
});

// in a component definition

<ViewTransition default={transitionClass}>
  <Content />
</ViewTransition>
```

### Linter: `validImports`

The `@stylexjs/eslint-plugin` package now supports the `validImports` option for all rules, allowing you to configure where the linter expects StyleX to be imported from. This is equivalent to the [`importSources`](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/configuration/babel-plugin/#importsources) option for the compiler. Thanks to [@javascripter](https://github.com/javascripter) for this improvement.

```ts
{
  // Default: ['stylex', '@stylexjs/stylex']
  validImports: Array<string | { from: string, as: string }>,
}
```

## Breaking changes

### Style resolution

StyleX will now use `property-specificity` instead of `application-order` as the default value for the `styleResolution` option (the strategy used to merge styles). The difference between these 2 strategies is as follows:

* `application-order`
  * The last style wins, i.e., `margin` wins over `marginTop` if it appears last in the order of styles.
  * Larger generated JavaScript objects.
* `property-specificity`
  * The more specific style wins, i.e., `marginTop` wins over `margin` irrespective of the order of styles.
  * Disallows more shorthands, e.g., `background`, `border`.
  * Smaller generated JavaScript objects.

If you experience visual regressions, set `styleResolution` to `application-order`. However, the [performance metrics](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/pull/1064) we track are all significantly improved or neutral when using `property-specificity`, therefore, we strongly encourage migration.

## Fixes

* [babel-plugin] Fix theming in dev/debug mode.
* [eslint-plugin] Add autofix support for all remaining nonstandard CSS properties to the `valid-styles` rule.
* [stylex] Fix the TypeScript types. Thanks to [@pawelblaszczyk5](https://github.com/pawelblaszczyk5) for this improvement.
