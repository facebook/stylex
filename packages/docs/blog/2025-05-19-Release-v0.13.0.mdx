# Release 0.13.0

StyleX v0.13.0 introduces two new APIs and several breaking changes to compiler defaults, alongside various bug fixes.

## New APIs

### `defineConsts`

We've added a new `defineConsts` API to allow for declaration and use of constant values. Unlike `defineVars`, these are inlined at build-time and do not generate CSS variables. This is a long requested feature that allows for shareable media queries.

```tsx title="constants.stylex.js"
export const breakpoints = stylex.defineConsts({
  small: '@media (max-width: 600px)',
  medium: '@media (min-width: 601px) and (max-width: 1024px)',
  large: '@media (min-width: 1025px)',
});

export const colors = stylex.defineConsts({
  brand: '#0055FF',
  surface: '#FFFFFF',
  text: '#111111',
});
```

You can then import and use these constants in any `create` call:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import { breakpoints, colors } from './constants.stylex.js';

const styles = stylex.create({
  container: {
    padding: {
      default: '4px'
      [breakpoints.small]: '8px',
      [breakpoints.medium]: '16px',
      [breakpoints.large]: '24px',
    },
  },
  label: {
    color: colors.text,
  },
});
```

### `positionTry`

`positionTry` enables graceful fallback positioning via the `@property-try` at-rule. This makes it easier to handle layout edge cases across varying browser support and runtime constraints.  (Thanks [nmn](https://github.com/nmn)!)

```tsx
const fallback = stylex.positionTry({
  positionAnchor: '--anchor',
  top: '0',
  left: '0',
  width: '100px',
  height: '100px',
});

const styles = stylex.create({
  box: {
    positionTryFallbacks: fallback,
  },
});
```

## Breaking changes

* The `attrs` API is removed due to low usage and redundant functionality; non-React users can replace it with a wrapper around `props` as documented [here](https://stylexjs.com/docs/api/javascript/props/#not-using-react).
* The `runtimeInjection` compiler option is now disabled by default in development mode (`dev:true`) to better match production behavior.
* ESLint rule `no-legacy-conditional-styles` is renamed to `no-legacy-contextual-styles`.
* The config option `useRemForFontSize` is renamed to `enableFontSizePxToRem`; now disabled by default and not intended for external use.
* The config option `genConditionalClasses` is renamed to `enableInlinedConditionalMerge`; now enabled by default and not intended for external use.

## Fixes

* Fixed duplicate classNames in styles with nested pseudo-classes (Thanks [jeongminsang](https://github.com/jeongminsang)!)
* ESLint plugin now correctly supports `importSources` object syntax in `validImports` (Thanks [javascripter](https://github.com/javascripter)!)
* Fixed a bug where CSS variables would be wrapped in quotes when used with the `content` property.
* Fixed evaluation bug in `firstThatWorks` when the final value was a CSS variable.
* Fixed TypeScript types for themes and types functions.

## Miscellaneous

* Rewrote the runtime style injection system to be more robust in dev. This resolves issues with hot reloading and duplicate style tags.
* Added Flow types for anchor positioning. (Thanks [Jta26](https://github.com/Jta26)!)
* Added support for custom `importSources` in the PostCSS plugin for [React Strict DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom) compatibility. (Thanks [javascripter](https://github.com/javascripter)!)
* Improved compiler error messages.

## Deprecations

Weâ€™ve deprecated the `@stylexjs/shared` package on npm.
