```tsx
type Theme<T extends VarGroup<unknown, symbol>>
```

A `Theme` is a type that represents a style that *themes* a set of variables in a given
`VarGroup`. It's the result of calling [`createTheme`](/docs/api/javascript/createTheme).


```tsx
import type {VarGroup} from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

import {vars} from './vars.stylex';

export const theme: Theme<typeof vars> = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  color: 'red', // OK
  backgroundColor: 'blue', // OK
});
```

The most common use-case for `Theme` is to accept a theme for a particular set of variables.

While, it's not needed in most cases, `Theme` also accepts an optional second type type argument.

<Accordion title="Advanced use-case: unique type identity for a Theme">

Two themes for the same `VarGroup` have the same type by default. In most cases,
this is the desired behavior. However, in some cases, you may want each theme to
have a unique type identity to constrain the themes that can be passed into a
particular component.

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import type {Theme} from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import {vars} from './vars.stylex';

declare const Tag: unique symbol;
export const theme1: Theme<typeof vars, Tag> = stylex.createTheme(vars, {
  color: 'red', // OK
  backgroundColor: 'blue', // OK
});
```

Now, `theme1` has a unique type identity and a different `Theme` for `vars`
would not satisfy `typeof theme1`.

This advanced use-case should be rarely needed, but it's available when it is.
