title: "Merge Themes"
---

`Theme`s for the *same* `VarGroup` are mutually exclusive and do not merge.
Any variable in a `VarGroup` that is not explicitly overridden in a `Theme` for that `VarGroup`
is set to its default value.

However, you can reuse common constants when defining multiple themes for a particular
`VarGroup` and avoid excessive repetition.

## Example

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
import { vars } from './variables.stylex';

const themeBlueVars = {
  backgroundColor: 'blue',
};
const themeBlue = stylex.createTheme(vars, themeBlueVars);

const themeBigVars = {
  size: '128px',
};
const themeBig = stylex.createTheme(vars, themeBigVars);

const themeBigBlueVars = {...themeBlueVars, ...themeBigVars};
const themeBigBlue = stylex.createTheme(vars, themeBigBlueVars);
```

The StyleX compiler is able to resolve local object constants and merge them.
This is useful to be able to define a `Theme` that merges the values of two or more
other `Theme`s without repetition.
