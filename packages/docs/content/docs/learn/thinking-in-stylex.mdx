title: "Thinking in StyleX"
---


## Core Principles

To understand why StyleX exists and the reasoning behind its decisions, it may be
beneficial to familiarize oneself with the fundamental principles that guide it.
This may help you decide if StyleX is the right solution for you.

These principles should also be helpful when designing new APIs for StyleX.

### Co-location

There are benefits of DRY code, but we don't think that's usually true when it
comes to authoring styles. The best and most readable way to write styles is to
write them in the same file as the markup.

StyleX is designed for authoring, applying, and reasoning about styles locally.

### Deterministic resolution

CSS is a powerful and expressive language. However, it can sometimes
feel fragile. Some of this stems from a misunderstanding of how CSS works, but a
lot of it stems from the discipline and organization required to keep CSS
selectors with different specificities from conflicting.

StyleX aims to improve both the consistency and predictability of styles
_and_ the expressive power available. We believe this is possible through
build-tools.

StyleX provides a completely predictable and deterministic styling
system that works across files. It produces deterministic results not only when
merging multiple selectors, but also when merging multiple shorthand and longhand
properties (e.g. `margin` vs `margin-top`). The last style applied always wins.

### Low-cost abstractions

When it comes to the performance cost of StyleX, our guiding principle is that
StyleX should always be the fastest way to achieve a particular pattern.
Common patterns should have no runtime cost and advanced patterns should be
as fast as possible. We make the trade-off of doing more work at build-time to improve
runtime performance.

Here's how this plays out in practice:

#### 1. Styles created and applied locally

When authoring and consuming styles within the same file, the cost of StyleX is zero.
This is because in addition to compiling away `create` calls, StyleX also
compiles away `props` calls when possible.

So,

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';
const styles = stylex.create({
  red: {color: 'red'},
});
let a = stylex.props(styles.red);
```

Compiles down to:


<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JS Output" value="js-output">

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

let a = {className: 'x1e2nbdu'};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CSS Output" value="css-output">

```css
.x1e2nbdu { color: red; }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

There is no runtime overhead here.

#### 2. Using styles across files

Passing styles across file boundaries incurs a small cost for the
additional power and expressivity. The `create` call is not deleted
entirely and instead leaves behind an object mapping keys to
class names. And the `props` calls are executed at runtime.

This code, for example:

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = stylex.create({
  foo: {
    color: 'red',
  },
  bar: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
});

function MyComponent({style}) {
  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar, style)} />;
}
```

Compiles down to:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="JS Output" value="js-output">

```tsx
import * as stylex from '@stylexjs/stylex';

const styles = {
  foo: {
    color: 'x1e2nbdu',
    $$css: true,
  },
  bar: {
    backgroundColor: 'x1t391ir',
    $$css: true,
  },
};

function MyComponent({style}) {
  return <div {...stylex.props(styles.foo, styles.bar, style)} />;
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="CSS Output" value="css-output">

```css
.x1e2nbdu { color: red; }
.x1t391ir { background-color: blue; }
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>



This is a little more code, but the runtime cost is still minimal
because of how fast the `props` function is.

Most other styling solutions don't enable composition of styles across file
boundaries. The state of the art is to combine lists of class names.

### Small API surface

Our goal is to make StyleX as minimal and easy-to-learn as possible. As such we
don't want to invent too many APIs. Instead, we want to be able to lean on
common JavaScript patterns where possible and provide the smallest API surface
possible.

At its core, StyleX can be boiled down to two functions:

1. `stylex.create`
2. `stylex.props`

`create` is used to create styles and `props` is used to apply
those styles to an element.

Within these two functions, we choose to rely on common JS patterns rather than
introduce unique APIs or patterns for StyleX. For example, we don't have an API for
conditional styles. Instead, we support applying styles conditionally with
boolean or ternary expressions.

Things should work as expected when dealing with JavaScript objects and arrays.
There should be no surprises.

### Type-Safe styles

TypeScript has become massively popular due to the experience and safety it
provides. Our styles, however, have largely remained untyped and unreliable.
Other than some path-breaking projects such as
[Vanilla Extract](https://vanilla-extract.style/), styles are just bags of
strings in most styling solutions.

StyleX is authored in Flow with strong static types. Its packages on NPM come
with auto-generated types for both Flow and TypeScript. When there are
incompatibilities between the two type-systems, we take the time to ensure that we
write custom TypeScript types to achieve the same level of power and safety as the
original Flow.

_All styles are typed_. When accepting styles as props, types can be used to
constrain what styles are accepted. Styles should be as type-safe as
any other component props.

The StyleX API is strongly typed. The styles defined with StyleX are typed too.
This is made possible by using JavaScript objects to author raw styles. This is
one of the big reasons we have chosen objects over template strings.

These types can then be leveraged to set contracts for the styles that a
component will accept. For example, a component props can be defined to only accept
`color` and `backgroundColor` but no other styles.

```ts
import type {StyleXStyles} from '@stylexjs/stylex';

type Props = {
  //...
  style?: StyleXStyles<{color?: string; backgroundColor?: string}>;
  //...
};
```

In another example, the props may disallow margins while allowing all other styles.

```ts
import type {StyleXStylesWithout} from '@stylexjs/stylex';

type Props = {
  //...
  style?: StyleXStylesWithout<{
    margin: unknown;
    marginBlock: unknown;
    marginInline: unknown;
    marginTop: unknown;
    marginBottom: unknown;
    marginLeft: unknown;
    marginRight: unknown;
    marginBlockStart: unknown;
    marginBlockEnd: unknown;
    marginInlineStart: unknown;
    marginInlineEnd: unknown;
  }>;
  //...
};
```

Styles being typed enables extremely sophisticated rules about how
a component's styles can be customized with **zero-runtime cost**.

### Shareable constants

CSS class names, CSS variables, and other CSS identifiers are defined in a global
namespace. Bringing CSS strings into JavaScript can mean losing type-safety and
composability.

We want styles to be type-safe, so we've spent a lot of time coming up with
APIs to replace these strings with references to JavaScript constants. So far this
is reflected in the following APIs:

1. `create` Abstracts away the generated class names entirely. You deal
   with "opaque" JavaScript objects with strong types to indicate the styles
   they represent.
2. `defineVars` Abstracts away the names of CSS variables generated.
   They can be imported as constants and used within styles directly.
3. `keyframes` Abstracts away the names of keyframe animations. Instead
   they are declared as constants and used by reference.

We're looking into ways to make other CSS identifiers such as
`container-name` and `@font-face` type-safe as well.

### Framework-agnostic

StyleX is a CSS-in-JS solution, not a CSS-in-React solution. Although StyleX has
been tailored to work best with React today, it is designed to be used with any
JavaScript framework that allows authoring markup in JavaScript. This includes frameworks
that use JSX, template strings, etc.

`props` returns an object with `className` and `style` properties. A wrapper
function may be needed to convert this to make it work with various frameworks.

### Encapsulation

> All styles on an element should be caused by class names on that element
> itself.

CSS makes it very easy to author styles in a way that can cause "styles at a
distance":

- `.className > *`
- `.className ~ *`
- `.className:hover > div:first-child`

All of these patterns, while powerful, make styles fragile and less predictable.
Applying class names on one element can affect a completely different element.

Inheritable styles such as `color` will still be inherited, but that is the
_only_ form of style-at-a-distance that StyleX allows. In those cases too,
the styles applied directly on an element always take precedence over inherited
styles.

This is often not the case when using complex selectors, as the complex selectors
usually have higher specificity than the simple class selectors used for styles
applied directly on the element.

StyleX disallows this entire class of selectors. This currently makes certain CSS
patterns impossible to achieve with StyleX. Our goal is to support these patterns
without sacrificing style encapsulation.

StyleX is not a CSS pre-processor. It intentionally puts constraints on the power
of CSS selectors in order to build a fast and predictable system. The API, based
on JavaScript objects instead of template strings, is designed to make these
constraints feel natural.

### Readability & maintainability over terseness

Some recent utility-based styling solutions are extremely terse and easy to write.
StyleX chooses to prioritize readability and maintainability over terseness.

StyleX makes the choice to use familiar CSS property names to prioritize readability
and a shallow learning curve. _(We did decide to use camelCase instead of kebab-case
for convenience.)_

We also enforce that styles are authored in objects separate from the HTML
elements where they are used. We made this decision to help with the readability
of HTML markup and for appropriately named styles to indicate their purpose. For
example, using a name like `styles.active` emphasizes *why* styles are being applied
without having to dig through *what* styles are being applied.

This principle leads to trade-offs where authoring styles may take more typing
with StyleX than some other solutions.

We believe these costs are worth the improved readability over time. Giving each
HTML element a semantic name can communicate a lot more than the styles
themselves.

<Callout type="info">

One side benefit of using references to styles rather than using the styles
inline is **testability**. In a unit-testing environment, StyleX can be
configured to remove all atomic styles and only output single debugging
class names to indicate the source location of styles rather than the actual
styles.

Among other benefits, it makes snapshot tests more resilient as they won't
change for every style change.

</Callout>

### Modularity and composability

NPM has made it extremely easy to share code across projects. However, sharing
CSS has remained a challenge. Third-party components either have styles baked
in that are hard or impossible to customize, or are completely unstyled.

The lack of a good system to predictably merge and compose styles across
packages has also been an obstacle when sharing styles within packages.

StyleX aims to create a system to easily and reliably share styles along with
components within packages on NPM.

### Avoid global configuration

StyleX should work similarly across projects. Creating project-specific
configurations that change the syntax or behavior of StyleX should be avoided.
We have chosen to prioritize composability and consistency over short-term
convenience. We lean on linting and types to create project-specific rules.

We also avoid magic strings that have special meaning within a project globally.
Instead, every style, every variable, and every shared constant is a
JavaScript import without needing unique names or project configuration.


### One small file over many smaller files

When dealing with a large amount of CSS, lazy-loading CSS is a way to speed up
the initial load time of a page. However, it comes at the cost of slower
update times, or the *Interaction to Next Paint (INP)* metric. Lazy-loading
any CSS on a page triggers a recalculation of styles for the entire page.

StyleX is optimized for generating a single, highly optimized, CSS bundle that
is loaded upfront. Our goal is to create a system where the total amount of CSS is
small enough that all the CSS can be loaded upfront without a noticeable
performance impact.

Other techniques to make the initial load times faster, such as "critical CSS"
are compatible with StyleX, but should normally be unnecessary.
