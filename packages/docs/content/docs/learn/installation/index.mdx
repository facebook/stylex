## Runtime

All uses of StyleX require the runtime package to be installed.

<DevInstallExample prod={[`@stylexjs/stylex`]} />

## ESLint

Use ESLint to catch mistakes. StyleX has a forgiving compiler that will compile
invalid styles. The StyleX ESLint plugin will flag invalid styles and provide
fixes for common errors.

<DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/eslint-plugin`]} />

```tsx title=".eslintrc.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['@stylexjs'],
  rules: {
    '@stylexjs/valid-styles': 'error',
    '@stylexjs/no-unused': 'error',
    '@stylexjs/valid-shorthands': 'warn',
    '@stylexjs/sort-keys': 'warn',
  },
};
```

## Compiler

StyleX offers multiple ways to transform StyleX styles into CSS. Guides for
setting up the StyleX transformation pipeline for various bundler and framework
setups follow below:

- [Next.js](/docs/learn/installation/nextjs)
- [Vite](/docs/learn/installation/vite)
  - [React](/docs/learn/installation/vite/vite-react)
  - [React Server Components](/docs/learn/installation/vite/vite-rsc)
  - [React Router](/docs/learn/installation/vite/react-router)
  - [RedwoodSDK](/docs/learn/installation/vite/redwoodsdk)
  - [Waku](/docs/learn/installation/vite/waku)
- [Webpack](/docs/learn/installation/webpack)
- [Rspack](/docs/learn/installation/rspack)
- [Esbuild](/docs/learn/installation/esbuild)

You can also choose to use the [CLI](/docs/learn/installation/cli) or the
[PostCSS plugin](/docs/learn/installation/postcss), for more custom setups.

The recommended way to use StyleX in development and production is with the
build-time compiler. This can be done with any bundler that supports Babel -
using the metadata generated by the StyleX plugin - and with PostCSS.

<DevInstallExample
  dev={[`@stylexjs/babel-plugin`, `@stylexjs/postcss-plugin`, `postcss`]}
/>

Bundler- and framework-specific guides live under this Installation section. You
can also check the
[StyleX examples](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/tree/main/examples) to see
the same setups in runnable projects.

### Babel

You must configure your project's `.babelrc` file for StyleX to work as
expected. Please see the
[Babel plugin API reference](/docs/api/configuration/babel-plugin/) for more
details.

```tsx title=".babelrc.js"
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    ...
  ],
  plugins: [
    ...,
    [
      "@stylexjs/babel-plugin",
      {
        dev: process.env.NODE_ENV === "development",
        test: process.env.NODE_ENV === "test",
        runtimeInjection: false,
        treeshakeCompensation: true,
        unstable_moduleResolution: {
          type: "commonJS",
        },
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

### PostCSS

PostCSS provides a versatile way to integrate StyleX into your project. Create a
`postcss.config.js` file in your project root and add the StyleX plugin to it.

```tsx title="postcss.config.js"
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    '@stylexjs/postcss-plugin': {
      include: [
        './**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
        // any other files that should be included
        // this should include NPM dependencies that use StyleX
      ],
      useCSSLayers: true,
    },
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
};
```

Finally, ensure that your app's entry file imports a global CSS file that
includes the following declaration:

```css
@stylex;
```

The PostCSS plugin will replace the declaration with the generated StyleX
styles. Make sure that you only include this declaration once in your app.
