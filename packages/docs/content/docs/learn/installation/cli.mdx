title: 'CLI'

When none of the other integrations work, the StyleX CLI can be used to
pre-transform an entire directory of files to compile away StyleX and generate a
static CSS file which runs _before_ the rest of your build pipeline.

The only requirement for using the CLI is that your bundler is able to handle
CSS imports, as the CLI inserts an import for the generated CSS file into every
file that was transformed.

## Install

Start by installing the StyleX CLI:

<DevInstallExample dev={[`@stylexjs/cli`]} />

## Configuration

Although all options for the CLI are available as command line arguments, using
a configuration file is recommended. The configuration file can be in either
JSON or JSON5 format. Using JSON5 lets you skip quotes around object keys, and
use comments and trailing commas.

```js
{
  input: ['./source'],           // Where your StyleX source lives
  output: ['./src'],             // Where compiled files + CSS bundle are written
  cssBundleName: 'stylex_bundle.css',
  babelPresets: [
    ['@babel/preset-typescript', { allExtensions: true, isTSX: true }],
  ],
  styleXConfig: {
    aliases: {
      '@/*': ['./source/*'],
    },
  },
  // watch: true, // enable for incremental rebuilds
}
```

The configuration file can be named anything, as it is always passed explicitly
to the CLI using the `--config` flag.

## Using the CLI

Run the compiler with:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "build": "stylex --config .stylex.json5",
    "watch": "stylex --config .stylex.json5 --watch"
  }
}
```

You can add additional command line arguments, such as `--watch` for incremental
rebuilds.

You can also define multiple configuration files for different environments.
