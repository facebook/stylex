We're excited to release StyleX v0.7.0 with a new CLI to make it easier to
get started with StyleX, improvements to variables, and various bug-fixes.

## CLI

StyleX relies on a compiler that transforms your JavaScript code
*and* generates a static CSS file. However, integrating this compiler with
with your bundler can be tricky. So, while we continue to work on improving
the quality of our bundler integrations, we are introducing a new CLI as an
alternative!

The CLI transforms an entire folder. It generates an output folder where StyleX
has already been compiled away and a static CSS file has been generated. Further,
the CLI inserts an import statement for the generated CSS file into each file
that uses StyleX.

We are excited to offer this alternative to the bundler-based setup and are
choosing to release the CLI in an experimental state. We would love to hear
your feedback on how it works for you and what improvements you would like to see.

Special thanks to [Joel Austin](https://github.com/Jta26) for his work on the CLI.


## Literal names for CSS variables

When using, `defineVars`, StyleX abstracts away the actual CSS variable name,
and lets you use it as a JavaScript reference. Behind the scenes, unique variable names
are generated for each variable.

However, there are scenarios where it is useful to know the exact variable name. For
example, when you may want to use the variable in a standalone CSS file.

To address such use-cases, we have updated the `defineVars` API to use literals
that start with `--` as is. Other than the keys passed to `defineVars`, the
API is unchanged.

```ts
const vars = stylex.defineVars({
  '--primary-color': 'red',
  '--secondary-color': 'blue',
});
```

:::info Note

When using literals for variable names, StyleX cannot guarantee uniqueness.

## Bug Fixes and improvements

Additionally bug fixes to types, eslint rules and the bundler plugins has been made.
