Happy new year!

StyleX has been in development for over six years. It started as a way to solve
styling problems at the scale of [facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/). It
succeeded at Meta and became the default way to author styles for web surfaces.

StyleX was open-sourced a little over two years ago, in December 2023. Since
then, more teams outside Meta have started using it, including Figma, Snowflake,
and HubSpot. Hearing how it works for them has been valuable. The feedback has
been largely positive, and it validates that our core design decisions work well
for various use-cases.

Their feedback, along with how CSS itself continues to evolve, guides new
features and refinements. Within the last year, we've added APIs for View
Transitions, Anchor Positioning, and the
[`stylex.when.*`](/docs/api/javascript/types) APIs for combinator-based styling.

The new APIs are easy to notice, but a lot of progress is quieter. A recent
milestone was the release of the
[`@stylexjs/unplugin`](/docs/learn/installation/vite) package, which makes
integration in web projects much simpler than it used to be. Setup friction was
one of the most common pieces of feedback, and this new package is a big step
toward reducing it.

### A New Playground

The new playground has been public for a few weeks now, but we never formally
announced it. It is now the lowest-friction way to try StyleX on the
documentation site. The playground is made possible by a browser-compatible
version of the StyleX compiler that uses `@babel/standalone` to compile StyleX
right in the browser. As a result, it is smaller, faster, and more reliable than
before. It is now also possible, to share links to your code examples within the
playground.

A huge thanks to [Henry Q. Dineen](https://github.com/henryqdineen) for making
it a reality!

### A New Website

We have redesigned and rebuilt the entire website from the ground up as a
showcase of StyleX itself. For the last two years, the StyleX website was built
on Docusaurus 2. We rewrote some of the core UI components with StyleX, but a
large part of the site still relied on Docusaurus components. As a result the
website used a combination of traditional CSS, CSS Modules and StyleX for
styling. We were also stuck on an old version of React and updating to
Docusaurus 3 would have been a major effort.

The new website is built with Waku, a minimal React framework that lets us
benefit from, and showcase StyleX's compatibility with React Server Components.
Waku is built on Vite, which lets us leverage and dogfood the
`@stylexjs/unplugin` package.

For documentation features, we chose Fumadocs, a small and flexible
documentation framework that is compatible with Waku. It is modular enough that
we could rewrite all the UI components with StyleX. We translated the components
from `fumadocs-ui` and then customized them further. We are able to achieve a
more unique design without redundant code by using the features of StyleX and
modern CSS.

### Future

Work on StyleX continues and we have some
[big plans](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/issues/1356) for 2026. For now,
we're celebrating our journey so far.
