Happy New Year!

StyleX has been in development for just over six years. It started as a way to
solve styling problems at the scale of
[facebook.com](https://www.facebook.com/). It proved itself at Meta and became
the default way to author styles for web surfaces.

StyleX was open-sourced a little over two years ago, in December 2023. Since
then, more teams outside Meta have started using it, including Figma, Snowflake,
and HubSpot. The feedback has been largely positive and it validates our core
design decisions within various use-cases.

Their feedback, along with how CSS itself continues to evolve, guides new
features and refinements. Within the last year, we've added APIs for View
Transitions, Anchor Positioning, and the
[`stylex.when.*`](/docs/api/javascript/types) APIs for combinator-based styling.

The new APIs are easy to spot, but a lot of progress is quieter. A recent
milestone was the release of the
[`@stylexjs/unplugin`](/docs/learn/installation/vite) package, which makes
integration in web projects much simpler than it used to be. Setup friction was
one of the most common bits of feedback, and this new package is a big step
toward reducing it.

### A new playground

The new playground quietly made public a few weeks ago. It's now the
lowest-friction way to try StyleX without setting up a project. It is made
possible by a version of the StyleX compiler that uses `@babel/standalone` to
compile StyleX right in the browser. As a result, it's smaller, faster, and more
reliable than the previous playground. It's also now possible to share links to
your code examples within the playground.

A huge thanks to [Henry Q. Dineen](https://github.com/henryqdineen) for making
it a reality!

### A new website

We redesigned and rebuilt the website from the ground up as a showcase of StyleX
itself. For the last two years, the StyleX website was built on Docusaurus 2. We
rewrote some of the core UI components with StyleX, but a large part of the site
still relied on Docusaurus components. As a result, the website used a mix of
traditional CSS, CSS Modules and StyleX for styling. We were also stuck on an
old version of React and updating to Docusaurus 3 would have been a major
effort.

The new website is built with Waku, a minimal React framework that lets us
benefit from, and showcase StyleX's compatibility with React Server Components.
Waku is built on Vite, which lets us dogfood the `@stylexjs/unplugin` package.

For documentation features, we chose Fumadocs, a small and flexible
documentation framework that is compatible with Waku. It is modular enough that
we could rewrite all the UI components with StyleX. We translated the components
from `fumadocs-ui` and then customized them further. This let us achieve a more
distinctive design without redundant code by using the features of StyleX and
modern CSS.

### Future

Work on StyleX continues, and we have some
[big plans](https://github.com/facebook/stylex/issues/1356) for 2026. For now,
we are launching this new website as a celebration of the journey so far.
